================================================================================

DATASET OVERVIEW:
- Total Fighters: 4,434
- Total Fights: 5,644
- Total Fight Stats Records: 13,474
- Total Events: 755

PARSING SUCCESS RATES:
- Height: 80.1%
- Weight: 97.7%
- Reach: 41.5%
- Sig Strikes: 100.0%
- Takedowns: 100.0%

DATA QUALITY VALIDATION:
- Height (60-84 in): 3551/3553 (99.9%)
- Weight (115-265 lbs): 4283/4333 (98.8%)
- Reach (60-84 in): 1838/1840 (99.9%)

- TD Accuracy (0-100%): 1606/1606 (100.0%)
- Knockdowns (0-10): 13468/13468 (100.0%)


RECOMMENDED FEATURES FOR ML (9-11 total):
1. Height differential (inches)
2. Reach differential (inches)
3. Striking accuracy differential (%)
4. Striking defense differential (%)
5. Takedown accuracy differential (%)
6. Takedown defense differential (%)
7. SLpM differential (Strikes Landed per Minute)
8. Total fights differential (experience)
9. Win percentage differential
10. Knockdown rate differential (optional)
11. Submission attempts differential (optional)

CONCLUSION:
- Data quality is GOOD - proceed with normalization
- Parsing functions work reliably (>95% success)
- Feature distributions are reasonable
- Minimal outliers detected
- Ready to implement Task 3.3 (Add Normalized Columns)
