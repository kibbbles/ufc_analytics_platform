# UFC Scraper - Enhanced Production System

This directory contains the **production-ready UFC scraper** with comprehensive enhancements. It's been consolidated from 6 files down to **3 main files** for easier management.

## 🚀 How to Run the Scraper

### **Option 1: Automated Scheduling (Recommended)**

Start the scheduler that runs automatically:

```bash
# From backend/scraper directory
cd backend/scraper
python scheduler.py --daemon

# The scraper will now run:
# - Weekly on Sunday at 6:00 AM (perfect for UFC's ~2 events per month)
```

### **Option 2: Manual Execution**

Run scraping jobs manually:

```bash
# Run weekly scrape now
python scheduler.py --action run-weekly

# Or use the enhanced scraper directly
python enhanced_scraper.py
```

### **Option 3: Interactive Mode**

Start scheduler in interactive mode for testing:

```bash
python scheduler.py
# Then type commands: 'weekly', 'quit'
```

## 📁 File Structure (3 files total)

```
backend/scraper/
├── enhanced_scraper.py      # Main scraper with all enhancements
├── database_integration.py  # PostgreSQL database storage  
├── scheduler.py             # Automated scheduling system
└── README.md               # This file
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

The scheduler creates a `scheduler_config.json` file with these defaults:

```json
{
  "weekly_scrape_day": "sunday",          // Weekly scrape day
  "weekly_scrape_time": "06:00",          // 6 AM Sunday
  "max_events_per_run": null,             // No limit (UFC has ~2 events/month)
  "days_back_to_check": 14,               // Look back 2 weeks
  "enable_database_storage": true,        // Save to PostgreSQL
  "enable_csv_backup": true,              // Keep CSV backups
  "enable_data_validation": true,         // Validate data quality
  "log_level": "INFO"
}
```
